    "# 1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around objects rather than functions and logic. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects:\n",
    "Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can have.\n",
    "Object: An instance of a class. Each object can have unique attributes and can perform actions defined by its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also involves restricting access to some of the object's components, which is known as data hiding. This is typically achieved by using access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class (the child or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (the parent or base class). This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class. The two main types of polymorphism are:\n",
    "Method Overriding: A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "Method Overloading: Multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features to the user. It allows focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. Abstraction is typically achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "These concepts together form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming, enabling developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code."

    "# 3. Explain the difference between instance methods and class methods. Provide an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance methods and class methods in Python are both used within classes, but they serve different purposes and are bound to different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Instance methods are the most common type of methods in Python classes. They operate on an instance of the class (i.e., an object) and can access and modify the objectâ€™s attributes.\n",
    "Binding: They are bound to the instance of the class.\n",
    "Usage: Instance methods automatically receive the instance (self) as the first argument.\n",

    "car1.display_info()  # Output: Car Information: 2020 Toyota Corolla\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than its instances. They can modify class-level data, but not instance-level data.\n",
    "Binding: They are bound to the class itself and are not tied to any specific instance.\n",
    "Usage: Class methods automatically receive the class (cls) as the first argument. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    make = \"Generic Make\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, model, year):\n",

    "\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def change_make(cls, new_make):\n",
    "        cls.make = new_make\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Car Information: {self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "Car.change_make(\"Honda\")  # Change the class-level make\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Civic\", 2022)\n",
    "car1.display_info()  # Output: Car Information: 2022 Honda Civic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "1. Binding:\n",
    "Instance methods are bound to the object instance (self).\n",
    "Class methods are bound to the class (cls).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Access:\n",
    "Instance methods can access and modify both instance-level and class-level attributes.\n",
    "Class methods can only modify class-level attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Usage:\n",
    "Instance methods are typically used for operations that require access to individual object data.\n",
    "Class methods are used when you need to perform operations that pertain to the class as a whole, rather than any particular instance.\n"

    "# 4. How does Python implement method overloading? Give an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense, as seen in languages like Java or C++. In those languages, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (either in number or type). However, Python uses a different approach due to its dynamic nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Python Handles Method Overloading:\n",
    "Instead of method overloading, Python allows you to define a single method that can handle different numbers or types of arguments. This is typically done using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args and **kwargs), or by manually inspecting the types of the arguments within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Simulating Method Overloading:\n",
    "   \n",
    "class MathOperations:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=None, c=None):\n",
    "        if b is not None and c is not None:\n",
    "            return a + b + c\n",
    "        elif b is not None:\n",
    "            return a + b\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            return a\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "math_ops = MathOperations()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding two numbers\n",
    "print(math_ops.add(5, 10))  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding three numbers\n",
    "print(math_ops.add(5, 10, 15))  # Output: 30\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding one number (just returns the number itself)\n",
    "print(math_ops.add(5))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The add method in the MathOperations class can accept one, two, or three arguments.\n",
    "Depending on how many arguments are provided, it will perform the appropriate addition.\n",
    "This approach allows the add method to simulate overloading by handling different cases internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "Default Arguments: The method uses default arguments (b=None, c=None) to allow for different numbers of arguments.\n",
    "Conditional Logic: The method includes conditional checks to determine how many arguments were provided and performs the corresponding operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides the flexibility to handle different method signatures, although it lacks the strict method overloading mechanism seen in statically-typed languages.\n",

    "# 13. Explain the concept of the Diamond Problem in multiple inheritance. How does Python resolve it?\n",
    "The Diamond Problem is a classical issue that arises in languages supporting multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class. This creates ambiguity in method resolution, particularly when a method is defined in the common base class and inherited by multiple subclasses.\n",

    "How Python Resolves the Diamond Problem\n",
    "Python resolves the diamond problem using the C3 Linearization Algorithm, also known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). This algorithm ensures that each class appears only once in the inheritance hierarchy and in a consistent order.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRO and super()\n",
    "Python uses the MRO to determine the order in which base classes are searched when a method is called. When a method is called, Python follows this order to decide which method to execute, preventing ambiguity.\n",

    "How super() Works in the Diamond Problem: \n",
    "    \n",
